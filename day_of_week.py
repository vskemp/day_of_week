# Day of the Week
# Given the following code that prompts the user for a day number 
# (the int function converts a numeric string to a number):

# day = int(input('Day (0-6)? '))

# # Fill in your code here
# The user will enter a number between 0 to 6 inclusive. Given this number, 
# print a day of the week. 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so on. Here's an example user session (this assumes you've named the file day_of_week.py):

# $ python day_of_week.py
# Day (0-6)? 5
# Friday
# $ python day_of_week.py
# Day (0-6)? 0
# Sunday

day = int(input("Day (0-6)? "))

if day == 1:
  print("Monday")
elif day == 2:
  print("Tuesday")
elif day == 3:
  print("Wednesday")
elif day == 4:
  print("Thursday")
elif day == 5:
  print("Friday")
elif day == 6:
  print("Saturday")
elif day == 0:
  print("Sunday")
else:
  print("Not a valid entry.")
